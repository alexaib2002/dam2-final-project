## Overview

This was the final project of DAM. As such, it's built on top of technologies that weren't taught during the course, while emphasizing healthy development practices between all members of the group.

DataWorks focuses on developing an interactive and customizable user interface for interacting with a database. It provides key functionalities that facilitate data administration and manipulation.

One of the standout features of this interface is its support for user authentication. This means that users need to authenticate themselves before accessing the database, providing an additional level of security and control over who can access and make changes to the data.

Additionally, the project includes an initialization functionality based on a series of generation scripts. These scripts allow for configuring and setting up the initial structure of the database, making it easier to get it up and running.

Regarding the user interface itself, it has been designed intuitively and user-friendly so that users can navigate and work with the data easily. It provides a clear view of the available tables in the database, allowing users to select and explore the desired table.

Once a table is selected, the interface displays the records in an organized manner and provides options for interactive editing, adding, and deleting records. This enables users to make quick and precise changes to the data, enhancing efficiency in database management.
